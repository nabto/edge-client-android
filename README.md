# Nabto client sdk for Android.

The sdk is primarily built using swig using a cpp wrapper on top of
the c library.

The library is split in two libraries such that the
`libnabto_client.so` can be extracted and used directly with ffi
bindings or other mechanisms instead of using the jni wrapper which is
inside the `libnabto_client_jni.so` library.

The swig code is generated by calling generate_swig.sh from CMake, CMake is called from jni/build.gradle.


## Running a single test case

```
./gradlew :jni:connectedAndroidTest -Pandroid.testInstrumentationRunnerArguments.class=com.nabto.client.jni.ConnectionTest#connectRemote
```

## Debugging swig generation

`swig -c++ -java -debug-tmsearch nabto_client.i`, it can also be
appropriate to make a minimum reproduction and get the swig right in a
limited example.

## Working with android stack traces

```
./Android/Sdk/platform-tools/adb logcat > out.txt
./Android/Sdk/ndk-bundle/ndk-stack -sym sandbox/nabto-client-sdk/android-client/jni/build/intermediates/merged_native_libs/debug/out/lib/arm64-v8a/ -dump out.txt
```

## Open a remote pairing fragment

```
adb shell am start -W -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d 'heatpump://app/remote_pair_device?product_id=pr-bqyh43fb\&device_id=de-hkpcwynp\&server_key=sk-9d3028f1f3de68f0844ea544a42a4f05\&server_url=https://a.clients.dev.nabto.com' com.nabto.edge.heatpump
```


# QA needed for a library

## Lifecycle tests

The idea with these tests is that they should test app lifecycle events.

### Test Life 1.

An app should be able to handle activity lifecycle events described here:
https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/activity-lifecycle

  1. The app should be able to start and then be stopped.
  2. The app should be able to be paused and then resumed.
  3. The app should be able to be killed and then created.
  4. The app should be able to stopped and then restarted.



## Features

These test features of the client sdk

### Test Feature 1.

The app must be able to make a tunnel and it should be shown that a resource can be reached through the tunnel.

Scope: connectedAndroidTest

### Test Feature 2.

The app must be able to get logs from the nabto-client-sdk.

Scope: connectedAndroidTest

### Test Feature 3.

The app must be able to use a future both as blocking and nonblocking.

Scope: connectedAndroidTest

### Test Feature 4.

The app must be able to make a stream.

Scope: connectedAndroidTest

### Test Feature 5.

The app must be able to make a coap request.

Scope: connectedAndroidTest


## Connectivity

Test connectivity from an app with the nabto-client-sdk.


### Test Conn 1.

The app must be able to connect to a remote nabto-device.

Scope: connectedAndroidTest



### Test Conn 3.

The app must be able to connect to a local nabto-device on an ipv4 only local network.

Scope: connectedAndroidTest on a real device with given network

./gradlew :jni:connectedAndroidTest -Pandroid.testInstrumentationRunnerArguments.class=com.nabto.client.jni.ConnectionTest#connectLocal

### Test Conn 4.

The app must be able to connect to a local nabto-device on an ipv6 only local network.

Scope: connectedAndroidTest on a real device with given network

### Test Conn 5.

On android, if there is not internet access on a local network, then
by default no traffic is sent to that network.

The app must be able to connect to a local nabto-device on a network without internet access on a android-device which has internet access via 3/4/5g

Scope: connectedAndroidTest on a real device with given network
